Adventure 001: The Milky Mines of Møllehøj
============================================================

Place this adventure for characters levels 1–3 in a mountainous region.
The adventure is compatible with any classic fantasy roleplaying game.

A colony of quasi-magical fungus grows on this mountain.
Its tentacles root deep in the earth, like veins of living ore.
The natural chemistry of the fungus enriches the local soil.

A race of psychic hive-minded yaks savor green plants grown in that soil as a delicacy and mild intoxicant.
Local villagers often see the shaggy beats grazing the summer hills.

In addition to its vegetative characteristic, the fungus has a unique culinary property.
Cheese made with the fungus gives anyone who eats it a random trait of the creature that produced the cheese's milk.
For example, someone eating fungus cheese made from bat milk develops one of these random traits:

1. short, black-brown fur covers body
2. dramatically more sensitive hearing, especially for high frequencies
3. light sensitivity — fight at -1 in full daylight
4. forelimbs transmogrify into functional membranous wings

A group of xovlins, along with a wererat they revere, recently moved into an old mine in the mountain.
They hope to use cheese made from the fungus and the wererat's milk to infect a large population with lycanthropy.
The wererat plans to test this on the nearby village.

Furthermore, the xovlin shaman has been experimenting with the milk of various mammals, particularly milk of the psyaks.
The xovlins prize the levitation ability of the psyaks for two reasons:

- The xovlins enjoy the prospect of terrifying unsuspecting cheese eaters by making them float high into the air (via transmission of the psyak's _levitation_ ability).
- An ancient xovlin myth tells of giant bats that roost from the moon.
 One they've perfected levitation cheese, these xovlins hope to go to the moon to tame giant moonbats as mounts.

In order to secure psyak milk, the xovlins have kidnapped the psyak princess.
They hold her hostage in the mine to blackmail milk from the other psyaks.

Level 3: Xovlin Lair

1. 30′ octagon **Jail Cell**
 Anyone who falls down the shoot from The Nest room 4 lands here.
 The spring-loaded door and steep ramp make climbing _up_ the shoot difficult.
 Numerous hash marks from former prisoners scar the walls.

5. **Cheese Wheel Trap.**
 An 8′ wheel of crumbly orangish stone stands on its end here, at the crest of the corridor that slopes south-west.
 There is a faint metallic odor, combined with a dusty smell and a smell of burning plastic.
 The ancient cheese artifact careens perilously down the hallway, crushing (save) anyone who opens the **trapped door** in the intersection before disarming the trap using the **lever at A**.
6. **Psyak Princess Jail.**
 The xovlins hold the **psyak princess** hostage in this jail cell.
7. **Boudoir of the Rat Queen.**
 The **wererat** lounges on a gilt, velvet-cushioned recamier.
 Normal and giant rats frequent the room, reporting to their queen.
 A long, narrow tunnel heads up and north, eventually emerging on a hillside overlooking the nearby village.
8. **Game Room.**
 A 8×8 two-tone grid is chalked on the floor of this small room.
 Crudely-carved figurines, about 6″ tall, stand on some of the squares.
 Close examination reveals the figures are made of hard cheese.

 Four **giant rats** skulk here.
 Their filthy nest hides gnawed bones and **40 cp**.
